**SwipePad is a mobile-first dApp designed for Celo's MiniPay, revolutionizing how we connect with and contribute to causes we care about. Imagine Tinder, but for making a tangible difference in the world!** ✨

## 🌟 What is SwipePad? The Spark Behind the Swipe!

We believe everyone deserves the chance to make an impact, no matter how small their contribution. Yet, traditional philanthropy can feel distant, complex, and opaque. Millions are eager to help, but are hindered by outdated systems and a lack of direct connection to the causes they champion.

**The Problem We're Tackling:**

- Traditional donation platforms often feel clunky, slow, and lack real-time transparency.
- Billions of potential changemakers remain financially excluded from global funding ecosystems.
- It's hard to _feel_ the impact of your donation and connect with the stories behind the campaigns.

**Our Solution: SwipePad - Philanthropy Reimagined!**
SwipePad offers a frictionless, engaging mobile experience that directly connects passionate donors with verified, high-impact campaigns. Using Celo's fast and affordable stablecoins (cUSD, cEUR, cKES, and more!), we're making micro-donations accessible, transparent, and empowering for _anyone_ with a phone.

It's more than just donating; it's about discovering, connecting, and becoming part of a global movement for good, one swipe at a time.

</div>

1. **Browse** ― User swipes through verified impact campaigns
2. **Choose** ― User selects donation amount and currency
3. **Donate** ― Funds transfer directly via DonationPool contract on Celo
4. **Track** ― Both donor and campaign creator can verify the transaction on-chain

### Donation Flow

For a detailed explanation of the donation flow, see our [donation flow documentation](./docs/milestones/donation-flow.md).

### Smart Contract Architecture

The DonationPool contract is a purpose-built solution for handling donations with two funding models:

1. **All or Nothing (Kickstarter model)**:

    - Creators receive funds only if the funding goal is met
    - Donors can claim refunds if the goal isn't reached

2. **Keep What You Raise**:
    - Creators receive all donations regardless of goal achievement
    - Suitable for campaigns that can make partial progress

## 🚀 Getting Started

> 💻 Explore the live version at: [https://swipe-pad.vercel.app](https://swipe-pad.vercel.app)

### Prerequisites

You'll need:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) (v1.0+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (v15+)

### Database Setup

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"
```

2. Start your local PostgreSQL instance using Docker:

```bash
# Start the PostgreSQL container and WebSocket proxy
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Initialize and seed the database:

```bash
# Generate migrations
bun run db:generate

# Push migrations to database
bun run db:push

# Seed database with sample data
bun run db:minimal-seed
```

#### Database Commands

| Command           | Description                                            |

| `db:clean-seed`   | Seed database with comprehensive sample data using SQL |
| `db:clear`        | Delete all data from all tables                        |
| `db:reset`        | Reset database to initial state                        |
| `db:check`        | Check for pending migrations                           |
| `db:drop`         | Drop all tables                                        |

| `db:down`         | Full cleanup (drop, push)                              |

#### Common Database Workflows

**Complete Reset:**

```bash
docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up -d && bun run db:push && bun run db:minimal-seed
```

**Visual Database Explorer:**

```bash
bun run db:studio
```

**Development Setup:**
For local development, the project is configured to use both local PostgreSQL and Neon serverless Postgres. By default, it will connect to your local PostgreSQL instance, but you can add a Neon connection string to `.env.local` to use in production environments.

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ReFi-Starter/swipe-pad.git
cd swipe-pad

# Use our script to set up the project with Bun
./scripts/bun-postinstall.sh

# Compile contracts
cd contracts && forge build && cd ..

# Generate contract hooks
./scripts/generate-types.sh

# Start development server
bun run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Important Notes about Bun

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) instead of npm for package management. Key points:

- **Install packages:** `bun install <package-name>` or `bun add <package-name>`
- **Run scripts:** `bun run <script-name>` (e.g., `bun run dev`)
- **Lock file:** Bun uses `bun.lockb` instead of `package-lock.json`

If you run into dependency issues, use our cleanup script:

```bash
./scripts/bun-postinstall.sh
```
