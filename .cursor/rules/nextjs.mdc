# Next.js Best Practices

## App Router Guidelines

- Use the App Router architecture for all new components
- Follow the recommended folder structure:
  - `src/app/*`: Routes and layouts
  - `src/components/*`: Reusable components
  - `src/lib/*`: Utilities and shared code

## Server Components

- Use Server Components by default
- Only use Client Components when necessary:
  - Interactive UI
  - Browser APIs
  - React hooks
- Add 'use client' directive at the top of Client Components
- Keep heavy logic in Server Components when possible

## Data Fetching

- Prefer Server Components for data fetching
- Use React Server Actions for mutations
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Cache API responses appropriately

## Performance Optimization

- Implement proper code splitting
- Use Image component for all images
- Prefer static rendering when possible
- Implement proper ISR/SSG strategies

## Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Ensure responsive design for all components
- Use CSS variables for theming

## Forms and Validation

- Use React Hook Form for client-side forms
- Implement proper server-side validation
- Use Zod for type validation
- Handle form errors gracefully
