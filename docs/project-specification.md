## Product Overview

## Business Model

- **Revenue Strategy**: 2% platform fee on successful donations
- **Value Proposition**: Frictionless mobile experience connecting donors directly to projects

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, Framer Motion
- **Web3 Stack**: Wagmi 2, Viem, MiniPay wallet integration
- **Backend**: Neon PostgreSQL (serverless), tRPC for type-safe APIs
- **Blockchain**: Celo network, Solidity smart contracts (DonationPool)
- **Package Manager**: Bun instead of npm

## Key Features
- **Swipe Interface**: Tinder-like UX for discovering projects
- **Multi-currency**: Support for cUSD, cEUR, cKES, and other Celo stablecoins
- **Flexible Funding**: All-or-Nothing or Keep-What-You-Raise models
- **On-Chain Transparency**: Fully verifiable donations
- **Social Elements**: User profiles, activity tracking, community tags

## Donation Flow
1. **Creator** publishes project with details, funding goal, and deadline
2. **Donors** swipe through projects and make instant donations
3. **Funds** are stored in smart contract until goal/deadline
4. **Creator** withdraws funds after successful campaign
5. **Refunds** automatically processed if goal not met (All-or-Nothing model only)

## Smart Contract Architecture
The DonationPool contract manages the entire lifecycle with two funding models:
- **All-or-Nothing**: Creators receive funds only if goal is met
- **Keep-What-You-Raise**: Creators receive all donations regardless of goal
